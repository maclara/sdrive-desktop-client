Download and install Vagrant for your OS (you need at least v1.5)

	https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

Next, make sure to install VirtualBox (Ubuntu users can install virtualbox via
apt-get):

	https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

After this is complete, you are ready to go. From a cmd line shell, cd into the
sdrive git repo and run this command:

	vagrant up

This will download and provision a virtual machine with all of the needed data
and start it up.

After this, you can execute ./build-win32.sh to build the Windows Client.

If you need to access the VM OS directly (e.g. to access the mysql database),
simply use the following command. The default user has sudo access. Mysql user
is 'root' with no password.

	vagrant ssh

Other useful commands:

	vagrant reload (restarts the VM)

	vagrant halt (stops the VM, can later be restarted with "vagrant up")

	vagrant destroy (completely removes the VM, create a new on with
	"vagrant up")

	vagrant status (tells you if the VM is running or halted)
